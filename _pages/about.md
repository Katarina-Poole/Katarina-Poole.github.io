# About me

Lorem epsum



# Research overview
## How does the brain process the surrounding acoustics?

My work has focused on how the brain from a single neuron level to a more macroscope network scale deals with pulling out higher level features from the incoming acoustic input such as whether the stimulus is predictable or whether a change has appeared in a complex spatialised scene.

## How can we use technology to aid acoustic perception?



## Where can we apply this knowledge and technology?
